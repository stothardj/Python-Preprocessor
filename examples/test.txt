!ifdef DEBUG
I could have code with tons of debug messages here
It would be annoying to switch between that
and the next few lines every time we want to put
a demo on the site
!else
So by not defining debug we would see this code
instead. This could be useful.
!ifdef CAKE
This is a nested if. Cake should be defined by otherfile.txt
so seeing this is correct
!else
This message should not be shown
!endif
And we are back into the part which should be shown.
!endif

My code goes here
