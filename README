This is a general preprocessor written in python. It is not
really intended to be used on python, since python doesn't
really need it. This is just a bit of glue for my coffeescript, based
on c preprocessor, but simple enough that it won't do anything
it's not supposed to and not conflicting with # as comments

Syntax:

!define
!include
!undefine
!ifdef
!else
!endif
!include
!import

Note that right now this is just to handle easy including,
so it doesn't do anythig with what you define things as. Feel
free to do anything with this code.
